            <p>Right, mate. I've been knocked down, taken out, hit from both sides hundreds of times - and that was just
                in a one gauntlet run on a Thursday. But this... this one was a blast! Big Sister's crap of a gang
                blindsided me at the shop. I mean, do they think they're from the bloody Fringe Worlds? They ain't that
                tough. I'm just sayin' if ya gonna throw a party at least book a DJ... or a band if you prefer real
                music, but don't just show up causin' a ruckus and expect not to get a punch in the bloody face. Those
                plonkers were just pissed that I ran circles around them in the club - cleaned â€˜em out pretty good if I
                don't say so myself. But I ain't stayin' down. Never do. And now, I'm in the bloody big leagues. No more
                brawlin' for coin against small-town street gangs - Ab aur nahin. My shop may be gone, but the name
                'Rampart' ain't. I reckon only one thing left to do... go out, make it Legendary, and be back in time
                for a midnight pint. Now THAT's a Thursday.
