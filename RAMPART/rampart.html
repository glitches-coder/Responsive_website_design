            <p>Right, mate. I've been knocked down, taken out, hit from both sides hundreds of times - and that was just
                in a one gauntlet run on a Thursday. But this... this one was a blast! Big Sister's crap of a gang
                blindsided me at the shop. I mean, do they think they're from the bloody Fringe Worlds? They ain't that
                tough. I'm just sayin' if ya gonna throw a party at least book a DJ... or a band if you prefer real
                music, but don't just show up causin' a ruckus and expect not to get a punch in the bloody face.
