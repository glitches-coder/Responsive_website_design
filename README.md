Hi Viewer,
This is a gaming website designed by me as a capstone project. This website has a lot of assets so the page loading times might be slow initially,
so please be patient.
The website is responsive and involves unique designs in css and JS that i wanted to apply.
THE VIDEO LANDING PAGES ARE TAKING LONGER TO LOAD DUE TO LARGE FILE SIZES, SO PLEASE WAIT FOR THE VIDEO.

Take a look>>>>
