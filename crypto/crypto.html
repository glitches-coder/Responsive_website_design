            <p>You can only trust those who you know are liars. I used to think differently back when I was working as
                a simple computer engineer. A straight-edge job with no bumps - I would go in, do what I was asked, and
                leave. I rarely doubted the loyalty of those who worked alongside me, I didn't really care, until the
                contract came in... a service order from: Q.W. Initials. That's all I know of the person who took my
                life away from me. And that is why I am here now. That is why I did what I did to get into the Games.
