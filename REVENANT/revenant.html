            <p>Now there are no more lies. And soon, no more Hammond. You target one Hammond facility after another. And
                the skinsuits are too busy waging war to care. They blame the Militia, write the dead off as casualties
                of war. It's not really a lie. It's someone's war... just not theirs. When you slit the last employee's
                throat… now what? Whatever your heart desires, I suppose… except you don't have a heart, and all you
                desire is what you were programmed to do in the first place. Ain't that a bitch. Question: who gets to
                die next? Answer: Anybody you want. This is the Outlands, baby. There's no law. No order. And you're the
                boogeyman. Or, at least, you will be. Soon enough. So when somebody vanishes without a trace? That's
                you. When murder goes unsolved? That's you. Your revenge isn't aimed at one person. It's aimed at every
                person. It's aimed at any person. An endless supply of skin suits, and so much time to kill. What are
                you waiting for, little simulacrum? Get to work...
