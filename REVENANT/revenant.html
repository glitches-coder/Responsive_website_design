            <p>Now there are no more lies. And soon, no more Hammond. You target one Hammond facility after another. And
                the skinsuits are too busy waging war to care. They blame the Militia, write the dead off as casualties
                of war. It's not really a lie. It's someone's war... just not theirs. When you slit the last employee's
                throat… now what? Whatever your heart desires, I suppose… except you don't have a heart, and all you
                desire is what you were programmed to do in the first place.
